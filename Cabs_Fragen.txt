Are there running multible programms at the same time in an operating system;Yes
What are operating systems;They let the user communicate with the hardware
What is a operating system good for;It manges the resoursces for the process that wants to acces a part of the hardware 
Tell me 5 Keyfeature of an operating system; Parrallel programm execution Memory management File systems Peripherals Computers Security
Why to stduy Operating Systems;They hide a way the complexity of hardware
Is it important as an developer to unterstand what happens behind the scenes of an operating system;Yes
What are peripherals;Input Output Storage Devices
What is the memory Hierarchy;1) Registers 2) Cache 3) Main Memory 4) Hard Disk(HDD/SSD) 5) Tape
What is a root system;Where every file/directory comes from the root path
What are the main benifits of grounping Files;Grouping Files are organizied Files on certiain criteria
What does rwx stand for;read write execute 
Does rwx also exsit in windows;yes but modifyed
What does a CPU stand for and what does it do;It stands for Central Processing Unit and it executes 
What does a RAM stand for and what does it do; It stands for Random Acess Memory and Programms are loaded to the RAM before Execution 
What type of disks do you know;HDD and SSD 
How man Computer Buses are there;3
Does every CPU have an instruction set;Yes
What are the two main Instruction sets;X86 and ARM 
What does CISC stand for;Complex Instruction Set Computer
What does RISC stand for;Reduced Instruction Set Computer 
What is the combination of the control unit ALU and registers called;core processing power 
What is the peropes of the Control U;nit;It is responsible for the sequential executuion of the programm that is located in the ram Decodes Machine iNstructions
Where are Registers located;cpu
What are register;very small memory unit on the cpu 
What do register do;Keeping operands and results
What is the Programm Counter;Containes the adress of the next instruction in RAM
What is the INstruction Register;Containes the instruction to be executed right now
What is the Programm Status word(PSW);Status of the last calculation (overflow,negativ,zero)
What is the Stack Pointer;Points to the begin of the current stack memory
What is the ALU;The ALU Performance Calulations and is controlled by the Control Unit
What is the Von-Neuman Cycle;Fetch Decode Fetch operands Executre Write Back
Is the the data lost when the RAM has no power;yes
What is an HDD;Hard Disk Drives
What is an SSD;Solid State Disks
What is faster Non volatile memory or SSD;Non volatile memory
What is faster SSD or HDD;SSD
Where should you install windows;SDD
What is the Data Bus used for;Read or Write of Data
What is the Adress Bus used for;It sends adress to the ram 
Is the Adress Bus Unidirectional or Bidirectional;Unidirectional
What is Unidirectional;It goes one way
What is Bidirectional;It goes both ways
What are the two modes of and OS;Kernel and User Mode
What os the user mode used for;Software
What is the Kernel Mode used for;Hardware
Why to modes;Security and Parts of the Instructions set must be protected

How to add two varibales together;ADD
How to switch in to Kernel mode;trap
What does POSIX stand for;Portable Operating System Interface
How to get information on a POSIX Systemcall;man <system_call>
Has POSIX diffrent Systemcalls then Win32;Yes
What is and IRQ;Interrupt Request
What does an IRQ do;It request an interrupt but doesn't interrupt the execution
WHat is an IRS;Interrupter Service Routine
What are the two diffrent interrupt types;Hardware and Software interrupt
What is an Hardware interrupt;specific lines / pins tells the Cpu to interrupt the current process
Can an masked interrupt be disabled;yes
Can a non masked interrupt be disabled;no
What is an non masked interrupt used for;error handling
